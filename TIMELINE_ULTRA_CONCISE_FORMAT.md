# Timeline Summary - Ultra-Concise Format

## Problem
Timeline summaries were still too verbose, taking up 3-4 lines when they should be 2 lines max.

Example of old format (too long):
```
"The proviso to Section 24 providing a time line of 60 days for disposal of the 
application was inserted vide Act 49 of 2001 w.e.f. 24.09.2001. Section 25 provides 
for grant of permanent alimony, which reads as..."
```

## Solution

### Enhanced Gemini Prompt - Ultra-Concise Rules
Updated `refactor_timeline_cli.py` with aggressive summarization:

**Key Changes:**
1. **"EXTREMELY CONCISE"** emphasis - only 2 lines MAX
2. **200 character limit** - roughly 2 normal lines
3. **Ultra-short format**: "Wife awarded Rs. 15,000/month" instead of "The wife was awarded maintenance of Rs. 15,000 per month"
4. **Abbreviations**: HMA, CrPC, Rs. instead of full names
5. **Concise formatting**: "Rs. 15,000/month" not "Rs. 15,000 per month"
6. **Removed all fluff**: no articles, minimal connectors

### Removed Visual Clutter
- Removed "(refactoring...)" loading indicator from frontend
- Cleaner, professional appearance
