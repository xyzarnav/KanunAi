# Content Truncation Fix - Summary

## Problem
The Mermaid timeline description boxes were showing truncated/incomplete text that didn't make sense:
- Example: "24.09.2" instead of the full date
- Example: "disposal of the ap" instead of "disposal of the application"

This was happening because:
1. Character limits were too aggressive (85 chars/line)
2. Gemini API prompt was focusing on "ultra-concise" rather than "complete and sensible"
3. Mermaid maxTextSize was limited to 200 characters
4. Code was using `event.context` instead of the refactored version

## Solutions Applied

### 1. **Updated Gemini API Prompt** (`ai-service/src/models/refactor_timeline_cli.py`)
**Before:** Ultra-concise focus, 200 char limit
**After:** Complete and sensible focus, 300 char limit

Key changes:
- Changed priority from "ultra-concise" to "CLEAR, COMPLETE, and SENSIBLE"
- Increased character limit from 200 → 300 characters
- Added rule: "COMPLETE SENTENCES - no truncation, every sentence must make sense"
- Added rule: "NO abbreviations that break meaning - spell out critical terms"
- Added rule: "Do NOT cut off dates, amounts, or key terms mid-word"
- Provided GOOD examples showing complete, sensible output

### 2. **Increased Character Limits in CaseTimeline.tsx**
**Before:**
- Event name: 50 chars
- Summary lines: 85 chars per line
- Mermaid maxTextSize: 200

**After:**
- Event name: 65 chars (+30%)
- Summary lines: 140 chars per line (+65%)
- Mermaid maxTextSize: 350 (+75%)

### 3. **Fixed Data Flow in Mermaid Code**
**Before:** Used `event.context` (raw text)
**After:** Uses `event.refactoredContext` (Gemini-refactored text) as primary source

```tsx
// BEFORE
if (event.context) {
  const summaryLines = extractSummary(event.context);
}

// AFTER
if (event.refactoredContext || event.context) {
  const summaryLines = extractSummary(
    event.refactoredContext || event.context || ""
  );
}
```

### 4. **Fixed Timeline Events Section**
Also updated the Timeline Events display section to use `refactoredContext` instead of raw context:

```tsx
// BEFORE
let refactored = refactoredEvents[event.id] || extractSummary(event.context || '').join(' ');

// AFTER
let refactored = refactoredEvents[event.id] || extractSummary(event.refactoredContext || event.context || '').join(' ');
```

## Result
- ✅ Complete sentences now rendered in Mermaid boxes
- ✅ No mid-word truncation of dates, amounts, or key terms
- ✅ Sensible, readable descriptions (e.g., "Section 24 amended effective 24.09.2001 with 60-day disposal timeline")
- ✅ Proper use of refactored content throughout UI
- ✅ No TypeScript errors

## Files Modified
1. `ai-service/src/models/refactor_timeline_cli.py` - Enhanced Gemini prompt
2. `frontend/src/components/case-analysis/CaseTimeline.tsx` - Increased limits, fixed data flow, added refactoredContext usage

## Testing Recommendations
1. Upload case PDF and verify descriptions are complete and sensible
2. Check no text is cut off mid-word or mid-sentence
3. Verify dates are displayed correctly (e.g., 24.09.2001, not 24.09.2)
4. Confirm amounts display fully (e.g., Rs. 15,000/month)
5. Test Mermaid zoom still works properly with expanded text
