---

**1. Document Overview**

This document serves as a detailed administrative manual for the Legislative Department, Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India. Its primary purpose is to outline the department's functions, organizational structure, operational procedures, and public interface, particularly in the context of the Right to Information Act, 2005. It is a descriptive and informational document, detailing how a key government department operates within India's legal and constitutional framework, rather than adjudicating a legal dispute or issuing judicial orders.

**2. Department's Core Functions and Legal Mandate**

The Legislative Department's mandate is primarily technical and service-oriented, rather than policy-making. Its core functions are:

*   **Principal Legislation Drafting:** Providing expert technical assistance in drafting all principal legislation for the Central Government. This includes Bills, Ordinances, Regulations for Union Territories, Constitution Amendment Bills, and President's Acts. Its historical role, established by an 1869 Resolution, is to "clothe with a technical shape projects of Law of which the policy has been affirmed elsewhere," underscoring its function as a legislative drafting body, not an initiator of policy.
*   **Subordinate Legislation Scrutiny:** Scrutinizing and vetting all subordinate legislation (rules, regulations, orders, bye-laws) issued by various Central Ministries and Departments. This ensures their legality, validity, constitutional compliance, and adherence to principles of administrative law and recommendations from parliamentary committees on subordinate legislation.
*   **Election Law Administration:** Administering Election Law and Electoral Reforms. This encompasses matters related to elections to Parliament, State Legislatures, the offices of the President and Vice-President, delimitation of constituencies, and processing references concerning the disqualification of Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs).
*   **Official Language Implementation:** A significant part of its mandate involves the progressive use of Hindi in the legal domain. This includes preparing, authenticating, and publishing authoritative Hindi texts of Bills, Acts, Ordinances, and statutory rules/orders, as mandated by Sections 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b) of the Official Languages Act, 1963. It also extends to translating Central Acts into other regional official languages and developing legal glossaries.
*   **Publication of Legal Texts:** Compiling, publishing, and maintaining authoritative versions of Central Acts, Ordinances, Regulations, the Constitution of India, and the India Code (a compilation of unrepealed Central Acts).
*   **Parliamentary Work:** Handling legislative matters related to Parliament, such as questions, resolutions, motions, and legislative assurances.

The department also administers legislation concerning subjects listed in List III (Concurrent List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, such as marriage, divorce, adoption, wills, succession, civil procedure, evidence, trusts, and charitable endowments.

**3. Constitutional and Statutory Framework**

The Legislative Department operates under a clear constitutional and statutory framework:

*   **Article 77(3) of the Constitution:** Its functions are assigned "Under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961," made by the President of India under this Article, which empowers the President to make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of India.
*   **Articles 110, 117(1), and 117(3):** The department is involved in legislative proposals that require the President's recommendation, particularly those related to financial matters (Money Bills and Financial Bills).
*   **Article 240:** It deals with the promulgation of Regulations under this Article, which pertains to the power of the President to make regulations for certain Union Territories.
*   **Seventh Schedule, List III (Concurrent List):** The department's administrative responsibilities extend to subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List, allowing both the Union and States to legislate, such as civil procedure, contracts, arbitration, personal laws, and transfer of property.
*   **Official Languages Act, 1963 (Sections 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b)):** These sections mandate the preparation and authentication of authoritative Hindi texts of Central Acts and Ordinances, a core function of the department.
*   **Authorized Translations (Central Laws) Act, 1973 (Section 2(a)):** This Act provides for the authentication of translations of Central Laws into other official languages.
*   **Article 309:** The department is concerned with the making of recruitment rules for government services, as per this Article.
*   **President's and Governors' Powers:** The department facilitates the exercise of powers by the President for promulgating Ordinances and President's Acts, and by Governors for promulgating Ordinances in states under President's rule.

**4. Department's Operational Philosophy and Structure**

The manual highlights the department's operational approach, emphasizing its role as a specialized technical body:

*   **Technical Servicing Role:** The department's "proper function... is to clothe with a technical shape projects of Law of which the policy has been affirmed elsewhere." This foundational interpretation from 1869 guides its non-policy-making, technical role.
*   **Hierarchical Decision-Making:** Operational procedures involve a structured hierarchy, where proposals are examined by sections/units, submitted to Branch Officers, and then approved by higher authorities, including Joint Secretaries, the Secretary, and ultimately the Minister.
*   **Specialized Groups:** The main office is organized into six specialized groups, each led by a Joint Secretary and Legislative Counsel. These groups, staffed by officers of the Indian Legal Service, handle legislative proposals originating from specific Ministries/Departments, ensuring focused expertise.
*   **Rigorous Scrutiny Standards:** Officers are guided by strict principles of legality, validity, established precedents, administrative law, and the recommendations of parliamentary committees on subordinate legislation, ensuring the robustness of all legislative instruments.
*   **Uniformity in Drafting:** A key operational principle is to maintain uniformity and consistency in legislative drafting by extensively referring to earlier precedents from both Union and State laws.
*   **Limited Direct Public Interaction:** While its publications are publicly accessible, the department primarily functions as a service department to other government entities, with limited direct interaction with the general public.

**5. Key Responsibilities and Publications**

The department's responsibilities translate into a wide array of outputs and services:

*   **Legislative Drafting:** Production of all forms of Central legislation.
*   **Authoritative Publications:**
    *   The Constitution of India.
    *   The India Code (a compilation of all unrepealed Central Acts).
    *   Central Acts, Ordinances, and Regulations.
    *   The Manual of Election Law.
    *   Authoritative Hindi texts and translations of Central Acts into other official languages.
    *   Legal journals and literature in Hindi through Vidhi Sahitya Prakashan.
*   **Electoral Process Support:** Providing legal expertise and administrative support for national and state elections, including delimitation and addressing disqualification issues.
*   **Parliamentary Liaison:** Facilitating the legislative process in Parliament.
*   **RTI Compliance:** The manual details the designated First Appellate Authority, Central Public Information Officer (CPIO), and Assistant Public Information Officer (APIO), ensuring transparency and public access to information as mandated by the RTI Act, 2005.
*   **Budget Allocation:** The document also provides details on budgetary allocations for its Main Secretariat, Official Language Wing, and Vidhi Sahitya Prakashan, reflecting the resources dedicated to its diverse functions.

**6. Absence of Judicial Orders**

As an administrative manual describing the functions of a government department, this document does not contain any judicial pronouncements, relief granted, specific directions, or orders passed in the context of a legal case. Its purpose is informational and descriptive, not adjudicatory.

**7. Significance of the Department's Role**

The Legislative Department plays a critical, albeit often unseen, role in the governance of India:

*   **Ensuring Rule of Law:** By providing technically sound, legally valid, and constitutionally compliant legislative drafts, it is fundamental to upholding the rule of law. Its meticulous scrutiny prevents legal infirmities and ambiguities in both principal and subordinate legislation.
*   **Facilitating Governance:** As the primary legislative drafting body, it enables the executive to translate policy decisions into enforceable laws, thereby facilitating effective governance across all sectors.
*   **Promoting Linguistic Inclusivity:** Its dedicated Official Language Wing is crucial for the progressive use of Hindi in legal texts and for making laws accessible in other regional languages, thereby enhancing public understanding and participation.
*   **Upholding Democratic Integrity:** Through its administration of Election Law, the department contributes directly to the integrity and fairness of India's democratic processes.
*   **Institutional Memory and Accessibility:** By compiling and publishing the India Code and other legal texts, it acts as the institutional memory for Central legislation, ensuring that laws are systematically recorded, updated, and made accessible to the judiciary, legal professionals, and the public.
*   **Maintaining Legislative Consistency:** Its emphasis on precedents and uniformity in drafting helps maintain consistency and coherence across the vast body of Indian law, preventing conflicts and ensuring predictability.

In essence, the Legislative Department, as detailed in this manual, is an indispensable pillar of India's legislative and administrative architecture, ensuring the technical excellence, legal soundness, and constitutional propriety of the nation's laws.
