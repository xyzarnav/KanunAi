**2. KEY CLAUSES**
*   **Purpose of Agreement:** To establish confidentiality obligations for the Prospective Purchaser regarding information provided by the Landlord/Agent for the purpose of evaluating a possible acquisition of the Property.

*   **Definition of Confidential Information ("Information"):** This Agreement applies to all information received from the Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent, now or in the future, which is not readily available to the general public. All Information is deemed confidential, valuable, and proprietary (Clause 3).

*   **Disclaimer of Accuracy & Waiver of Recourse:** The Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided. The Prospective Purchaser assumes full responsibility for confirmation and verification of all Information and expressly waives all rights of recourse against the Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent with respect to the same (Clause 6).
*   **Representation of Authority:** The person(s) signing on behalf of the Prospective Purchaser represent that they have the authority to bind the party for whom they sign (Clause 7).
*   **Governing Law:** The Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Clause 8).

**3. FINANCIAL TERMS**
*   Not found. This section does not contain any financial terms, payment amounts, schedules, fees, penalties, or pricing models.

**4. OBLIGATIONS**
*   **Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent:**
    *   (Implied) Provide information to the Prospective Purchaser for the purpose of evaluating a possible acquisition of the Property.
    *   (Implied) Act as the primary point of contact for the Prospective Purchaser regarding the Property.
    *   (Implied) Potentially grant written permission for direct contact with other persons concerning the Property if requested and approved (Clause 5).
*   **Prospective Purchaser and/or Purchaser‚Äôs Agent:**
    *   Not disclose, permit the disclosure of, release, disseminate, or transfer any "Information" to any other person or entity (Clause 1).
    *   If an entity, take all appropriate precautions to limit the dissemination of the Information only to those persons within the entity who have a "need to know" and who are specifically aware of the Agreement and agree to honor it (Clause 2).
    *   Use all Information for the sole purpose of evaluating the potential acquisition of the Property, and not for any other purpose (Clause 4).
    *   Not contact directly any persons concerning the Property (e.g., Landlord‚Äôs employees, suppliers, tenants) other than Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent without their written permission (Clause 5).
    *   Assume full and complete responsibility for confirmation and verification of all Information received (Clause 6).
    *   The person(s) signing on behalf of the Prospective Purchaser represent that they have the authority to bind the party for whom they sign (Clause 7).

**5. DEADLINES & DATES**
*   **Contract Duration/Term:** The obligation of confidentiality "shall survive the terms of any listing agreement between the Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent." This indicates the confidentiality obligation is ongoing and extends beyond any related listing agreement, but no specific end date for the confidentiality itself is provided.
*   **Start and End Dates:** Not found (other than placeholders for signature dates).
*   **Milestone Dates:** Not found.
*   **Renewal Dates and Terms:** Not found.
*   **Notice Periods:** Not found.

**6. TERMINATION CLAUSES**
*   Not found. This section does not specify how the Confidentiality Agreement itself can be terminated. The confidentiality obligation is explicitly stated to "survive the terms of any listing agreement."

**7. RISK FACTORS & RED FLAGS üö©**
*   **One-Sided Disclaimer of Accuracy and Waiver of Recourse (Clause 6):** This is a significant risk for the Prospective Purchaser. The Landlord/Agent explicitly disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. More critically, the Prospective Purchaser "expressly waives all rights of recourse against Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent with respect to the same." This means if the information provided is inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, the Prospective Purchaser has no legal claim against the Landlord/Agent, placing the entire burden of due diligence and risk of misinformation solely on the Prospective Purchaser.
*   **Broad and Perpetual Confidentiality Obligation:** The confidentiality obligation "shall survive the terms of any listing agreement," implying it is indefinite or at least extends beyond the primary transaction period without a clear expiration date for the confidentiality itself.
*   **Acknowledgement of "Irreparable Harm" (Clause 3):** The statement that unauthorized disclosure "could cause substantial and irreparable harm to Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent" is standard in NDAs. However, it is a red flag for the Prospective Purchaser as it strengthens the Landlord's position to seek immediate injunctive relief (a court order to stop disclosure) rather than just monetary damages, even without proving actual financial loss.

**8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**
*   Not found. While the "Information" is deemed "valuable, and proprietary," this section does not explicitly address intellectual property ownership rights, license grants, or usage restrictions related to patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets beyond the general confidentiality of the information.

**9. LIABILITY & INDEMNIFICATION**
*   **Liability Limitation (for Landlord/Agent):** Landlord/Agent explicitly disclaim any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of information provided (Clause 6).
*   **Waiver of Recourse (by Prospective Purchaser):** The Prospective Purchaser "expressly waives all rights of recourse against Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent with respect to the same" regarding the accuracy or completeness of information (Clause 6). This effectively limits the Landlord/Agent's liability for potential misinformation.
*   **Indemnification Clauses:** Not found.
*   **Insurance Requirements:** Not found.
*   **Liability Caps:** Not found.

**10. CONFIDENTIALITY**
*   **Core Purpose:** The entire document is a "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT" specifically for a "PROSPECTIVE REAL ESTATE BUYER."
*   **Definition of Confidential Information ("Information"):** "all Information received from the Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent, now or in the future, which is not readily available to the general public." (Clause 3).
*   **Obligation of Non-Disclosure:** Prospective Purchaser "will not disclose, permit the disclosure of, release, disseminate, or transfer any information obtained hereunder (‚ÄúInformation‚Äù) to any other person or entity." (Clause 1).
*   **Internal Disclosure Controls:** If the Prospective Purchaser is an entity, it must limit dissemination to "need to know" persons within the entity who are aware of and agree to honor the Agreement (Clause 2).
*   **Purpose Restriction:** Information can only be used "for the sole purpose of evaluating the potential acquisition of the Property" and "shall not at any time or in any manner be used for any other purpose." (Clause 4).
*   **Survival:** The obligation of confidentiality "shall survive the terms of any listing agreement between the Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent."
*   **Acknowledgement of Harm:** Prospective Purchaser understands that unauthorized disclosure "could cause substantial and irreparable harm to Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent." (Clause 3).
*   **Contact Restrictions:** Prospective Purchaser cannot contact other persons concerning the Property (e.g., employees, suppliers, tenants) without written permission from Landlord/Agent (Clause 5).
