*   **No Direct Contact:** The Prospective Purchaser shall not contact directly any persons concerning the Property (e.g., Landlord‚Äôs employees, suppliers, tenants) other than Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent without their written permission (Clause 5).
*   **Disclaimer of Warranties:** Neither the Landlord nor Landlord‚Äôs Agent makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided (Clause 6).
*   **Waiver of Recourse:** The Prospective Purchaser assumes full responsibility for confirmation and verification of all Information and expressly waives all rights of recourse against Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent with respect to the same (Clause 6).
*   **Authority to Bind:** The person(s) signing on behalf of the Prospective Purchaser represent they have the authority to bind the party for whom they sign (Clause 7).
*   **Governing Law:** The Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State to be specified (Clause 8).

**3. FINANCIAL TERMS**
*   Not found. This section of the contract does not contain any financial terms, payment amounts, schedules, fees, penalties, or pricing models.

**4. OBLIGATIONS**
*   **Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent Obligations:**
    *   To provide information to the Prospective Purchaser for the purpose of evaluating a possible acquisition of the Property (implied by the agreement's preamble).
*   **Prospective Purchaser and/or Purchaser‚Äôs Agent Obligations:**
    *   **Maintain Confidentiality:** Not to disclose, permit the disclosure of, release, disseminate, or transfer any "Information" to any other person or entity (Clause 1).
    *   **Internal Information Control (for entities):** If a non-natural legal entity, to take precautions to limit dissemination of Information only to those within the entity who have a "need to know," are aware of the Agreement, and agree to honor it (Clause 2).
    *   **Sole Purpose Use:** To use all Information exclusively for evaluating the potential acquisition of the Property and for no other purpose (Clause 4).
    *   **No Unauthorized Contact:** Not to contact directly any persons concerning the Property (e.g., Landlord‚Äôs employees, suppliers, tenants) without the written permission of the Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent (Clause 5).
    *   **Verification of Information:** To assume full and complete responsibility for confirmation and verification of all Information received (Clause 6).
    *   **Represent Authority:** The person(s) signing on behalf of the Prospective Purchaser must have the authority to bind the party (Clause 7).

**5. DEADLINES & DATES**
*   **Contract Duration/Term:** The obligation of confidentiality "shall survive the terms of any listing agreement between the Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent." This indicates the confidentiality obligation is intended to extend beyond the duration of any related listing agreement.
*   **Specific Dates:** Not found, other than blank spaces for signature dates.
*   **Renewal Dates and Terms:** Not found.
*   **Notice Periods:** Not found.

**6. TERMINATION CLAUSES**
*   Not found. This section does not specify how the confidentiality agreement itself can be terminated, nor does it mention any termination fees or notice requirements for termination. The survival clause suggests a long-term or perpetual obligation.

**7. RISK FACTORS & RED FLAGS üö©**
*   **One-Sided Disclaimer of Warranties (Clause 6):** The Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent explicitly state they make "no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by them." This means the Prospective Purchaser cannot rely on the information being accurate or complete.
*   **Waiver of Recourse (Clause 6):** The Prospective Purchaser "expressly waives all rights of recourse against Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent with respect to the same." This is a significant red flag, as it means the Prospective Purchaser cannot pursue legal action against the Landlord or Agent even if the provided information is inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, and causes harm. The entire burden of due diligence and risk for information accuracy is shifted to the Prospective Purchaser.
*   **Broad Definition of Confidential Information & Presumption of Harm (Clause 3):** "All Information received... which is not readily available to the general public" is deemed confidential, valuable, and proprietary. Unauthorized disclosure, "even without intent to harm, could cause substantial and irreparable harm to Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent." This broad definition and presumption of irreparable harm could make it easier for the Landlord to claim a breach and seek remedies.
*   **Potentially Perpetual Confidentiality:** The clause stating confidentiality "shall survive the terms of any listing agreement" implies a potentially indefinite or very long-term confidentiality obligation, which can be restrictive for the Prospective Purchaser.

**8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**
*   Not found. While the "Information" is deemed "proprietary" in a general sense of business confidentiality, this section does not address specific intellectual property ownership rights, license grants, or usage restrictions related to patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other formal IP.

**9. LIABILITY & INDEMNIFICATION**
*   **Liability Limitation (for Landlord/Agent):** Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent explicitly disclaim any liability for the accuracy or completeness of the information provided (Clause 6).
*   **Waiver of Recourse (by Prospective Purchaser):** The Prospective Purchaser "expressly waives all rights of recourse against Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent" regarding the information (Clause 6), effectively limiting the Landlord's and Agent's liability for information quality.
*   **Indemnification Clauses:** Not found.
*   **Liability Caps:** Not found.
*   **Insurance Requirements:** Not found.

**10. CONFIDENTIALITY**
*   **Agreement Type:** Confidentiality Agreement (NDA).
*   **Purpose:** To protect "highly confidential" information provided by Landlord/Agent to Prospective Purchaser for the purpose of evaluating a possible acquisition of the Property.
*   **Definition of "Information":** "Any information obtained hereunder" (Clause 1), and "all Information received from the Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent, now or in the future, which is not readily available to the general public" (Clause 3).
*   **Confidentiality Obligation:** Prospective Purchaser "will not disclose, permit the disclosure of, release, disseminate, or transfer any information obtained hereunder (‚ÄúInformation‚Äù) to any other person or entity" (Clause 1).
*   **Internal Disclosure Restrictions:** For non-natural legal entities, dissemination is limited "only to those persons within the entity who have need to know of the Information and who are specifically aware of the Agreement and agree to honor it" (Clause 2).
*   **Nature of Information:** Deemed "confidential, valuable, and proprietary" (Clause 3).
*   **Harm from Disclosure:** Unauthorized disclosure, "even without intent to harm, could cause substantial and irreparable harm to Landlord and/or Landlord‚Äôs Agent" (Clause 3).
*   **Permitted Use:** Solely for "evaluating the potential acquisition of the Property," and "not at any time or in any manner be used for any other purpose" (Clause 4).
*   **Survival:** The obligation of confidentiality "shall survive the terms of any listing agreement between the Landlord and Landlord‚Äôs Agent."
