This clause places the entire burden of verifying information on the Prospective Purchaser and explicitly waives all rights of recourse against the Landlord/Agent for any inaccuracies or incompleteness. This is a significant risk for the Prospective Purchaser.
*   **Indefinite Confidentiality (Survival Clause):** The confidentiality obligation "shall survive the terms of any listing agreement." This means the Prospective Purchaser's duty of confidentiality continues indefinitely, even if the property is not acquired or the listing agreement expires.
*   **Absence of Termination Clause:** The lack of a clear termination mechanism for the Confidentiality Agreement itself could lead to perpetual obligations for the Prospective Purchaser.
*   **Broad Definition of "Information":** While standard for NDAs, the definition "all Information received... now or in the future, which is not readily available to the general public" is broad and could encompass a wide range of data.

**8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

*   **Indemnification Clauses:** Not found. There are no clauses requiring one party to indemnify the other.

**10. CONFIDENTIALITY**
*   **NDA Terms:** This entire document is a Confidentiality Agreement.
