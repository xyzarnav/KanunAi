*   **Proper Use of Confidential Information:** Independent Contractor must only use Confidential Information for the proper performance of their duties and not disclose it to any person.
*   **Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information:** Independent Contractor and its employees are prohibited from disclosing or using Confidential Information for anyone other than the Client, both during and after the term of services.

*   **Assistance for IP Rights:** Independent Contractor must assist the Client in establishing, preserving, and enforcing IP rights in the Work Product, both during and after the Agreement term.
*   **Exclusive IP Ownership:** All property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, and patents, in any work produced are the exclusive property of the Client, unless a separate agreement states otherwise.
*   **Term:** The Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues in perpetuity.
*   **Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete:** Section 7 introduces these clauses, stating they apply "During the term of this Agreement after any termination," but the specific restrictions are incomplete in the provided text.

**3. FINANCIAL TERMS**
*   **Payment for Services:** The Independent Contractor is "strictly being paid as a 'work made for hire'" and payment for "Services" is "outlined in a separate agreement."
*   **Fees, penalties, late charges, hidden costs, pricing models:** Not found in this section.

**4. OBLIGATIONS**
*   **Client Obligations:**
    *   (Implied) To provide Confidential Information to the Independent Contractor.
    *   (Implied) To outline payment for Services in a separate agreement.
*   **Independent Contractor Obligations:**
    *   To perform "Services" to create a "Work Product."
    *   To not act as an employee, agent, partner, or joint venturer of the Client.
    *   To have no authority to act as agent for, represent, or bind the Client.
    *   To use Confidential Information only in the proper performance of their duties.
    *   To not publish or otherwise disclose Client's affairs or brief specificities to any person.
    *   To not disclose Confidential Information to anyone other than authorized Client employees or designated persons, during or after rendering services.
    *   To not use Confidential Information for the benefit of Independent Contractor, its employees, or any entity other than the Client.
    *   To agree that all Confidential Information, Work Product, and other results/systems developed are "work made for hire" and Client's sole property.

    *   To provide all reasonable assistance to Client, during and after the Term, for establishing, preserving, and enforcing Clientâ€™s IP rights in the Work Product.
    *   (Implied, based on incomplete clause) To adhere to non-solicitation and non-compete restrictions during and after the term.

**5. DEADLINES & DATES**
*   **Effective Date:** "___ day of ________________________, 20___" (placeholder). This is the commencement date.
*   **Contract Duration/Term:** "This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in perpetuity".
*   **Start and End Dates:** Start date is the Effective Date. No specific end date, as it continues "in perpetuity" unless terminated.
*   **Milestone Dates:** Not found.
*   **Renewal Dates and Terms:** Not found (due to perpetual term).
*   **Notice Periods:** Not found for general termination, but "termination is made, in writing, by the Client".

**6. TERMINATION CLAUSES**
*   **How can the contract be terminated?**
    *   "termination is made, in writing, by the Client".
    *   If "the Confidential Information no longer is considered proprietary and is publicly known."
*   **Termination fees or penalties:** Not found.
*   **Notice requirements:** "in writing" by the Client. No specific duration for notice is mentioned.

**7. RISK FACTORS & RED FLAGS ðŸš©**
*   **One-sided Terms:**
    *   **Perpetual Term:** The agreement continues "in perpetuity," which is an indefinite duration, unless terminated.
    *   **Client-initiated Termination:** The Client can terminate the agreement "in writing" at any time. The Independent Contractor's ability to terminate is not explicitly granted, except under the specific condition that Confidential Information becomes publicly known.
    *   **Broad Confidential Information Definition:** The definition is very extensive, including information "regardless of whether such Confidential Information has been expressly designated as confidential or proprietary," and derivative works created by the Independent Contractor.
    *   **Complete IP Ownership by Client:** All Work Product, Confidential Information, and other results are "sole and exclusive property of Client" as "work made for hire," with no explicit rights retained by the Independent Contractor for their own use or portfolio, beyond what might be in a separate agreement.
    *   **Waiver of Moral Rights:** Independent Contractor waives all moral rights, including the right to be identified as the author.
    *   **Post-Termination Assistance for IP:** Independent Contractor is obligated to provide assistance for IP rights "subsequent to the Term of this Agreement," which could be an ongoing burden.
*   **Non-compete or Restrictive Clauses:**
    *   **Perpetual Non-Disclosure:** The Independent Contractor cannot disclose confidential information "during the time of rendering services to the Client or thereafter," meaning the non-disclosure obligation is perpetual.
    *   **Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete (Incomplete):** Section 7 explicitly introduces "NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-COMPETE" clauses that apply "During the term of this Agreement after any termination." While the full scope is not provided, the mere presence of such clauses, especially post-termination, is a significant restriction on the Independent Contractor's future activities.

**8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**
*   **Ownership Rights:**
    *   All Confidential Information, the Work Product, and other results, systems, and information developed by Independent Contractor and/or Client in connection with the Services are considered "work made for hire" (17 U.S. Code Â§ 201 (b)) and are the **sole and exclusive property of Client**.
    *   This includes "all property rights, including but not limited to, copyrights, trademarks, patents, including any of the aforementioned pending application, and other intellectual property rights in any work produced."
    *   The only exception to Client's exclusive ownership is "a separate agreement stating otherwise."

    *   Independent Contractor cannot "use for the benefit of Independent Contractor and its employees or for any entity other than the Client, any information of confidential nature."
*   **Moral Rights:** Independent Contractor waives "any and all moral rights relating to the Work Product, including but not limited to, any and all rights of identification of authorship and any and all rights of approval, restriction or limitation on use, and subsequent modifications."

**9. LIABILITY & INDEMNIFICATION**
*   **Liability caps:** Not found.
*   **Insurance requirements:** Not found.
*   **Indemnification clauses:** Not found.

This obligation is perpetual.
    *   **Scope of Recipients:** Confidential Information may be furnished to Independent Contractor and/or Independent Contractorâ€™s affiliates, employees, officers, owners, agents, consultants, subcontractors or representatives.

**3. FINANCIAL TERMS**

*   Not found in this section.

**7. RISK FACTORS & RED FLAGS** ðŸš©

*   **One-Sided Injunctive Relief:** Clause 8 grants the Client a powerful remedy (injunctive relief) for breaches of confidentiality, explicitly stating that monetary damages may be insufficient. While common for confidential information, it highlights the Client's strong position in enforcing these terms.
*   **Blank Governing Law:** Clause 9, "GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in the State of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**8. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Independent Contractor understands and agrees that any use or dissemination of Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement will cause the Client irreparable harm, and that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information and that Client may be left with no adequate remedy at law; therefore, Client shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for any breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.
9. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in the State of ________________________ and be applicable to any and all Local and Federal laws.
10. SEVERABILITY. If a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final determination that any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, and all rights to appeal the determination have been exhausted or the period of time during which any appeal of the determination may be perfected has been exhausted, (i) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provisions held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused their duly authorized representatives to execute this Agreement as of the dates written below.
