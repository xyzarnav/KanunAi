---

## ✅ Data Pipeline Verification

### Frontend Component → API
- [x] Component calls: `refactorContextWithGemini(eventId, context, event.date)`
- [x] Passes: `{ context, parsed_date: event.date, maxLength: 3 }`
- [x] Verified: Date included in payload

### API Route → Backend
- [x] API receives: `{ context, parsed_date, maxLength }`
- [x] Forwards: Same payload to backend
- [x] Verified: Data passed through correctly

### Backend → Python CLI
- [x] Backend spawns: Python with CLI
- [x] Passes stdin: `{ context, parsed_date, maxLength }`
- [x] Verified: JSON correctly formatted

### Python CLI → Gemini
- [x] Receives: `{ context, parsed_date, maxLength }`
- [x] Sends to Gemini: `"Event Date: {parsed_date}\n...prompt..."`
- [x] Verified: Date context included

### Gemini Response → Display
- [x] Returns: Date-aware 2-3 line summary
- [x] Component caches: In refactoredEvents state
- [x] Renders: In Mermaid timeline + Timeline Events
- [x] Verified: Complete content displayed
